- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions  
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Jira, Slack  

## 🔭 Current Focus  

I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **microservices architecture**. I’m also exploring **Rust** for systems programming and **WebAssembly** for performance-critical applications.  

## 🌱 Learning Goals  

- Advanced Kubernetes orchestration  
- Machine learning with PyTorch  
- Building decentralized applications (dApps)  

## 💡 Approach to Development  

I believe in **clean code**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)**. I’m a strong advocate for **agile methodologies** and **collaborative problem-solving**.
